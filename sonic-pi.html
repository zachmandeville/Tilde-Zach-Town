	<h1>Sonic Pi Experiments!</h1>
	<div class="sonic-center bordered">
		<p>I got into programming through Sonic Pi, which is a "live coding synth".  It's a way to write songs, in real time, with code (a mixture of ruby and clojure I believe).</p>
		<p>I don't quite understand it, but I love it, and I wanted to share some of my thoughts and works on sonic pi here!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="sonic-center bordered">
		<p>First things first: you can download Sonic Pi at <a href="http://sonic-pi.net">sonic-pi.net</a> and I think you should!</p>
	<div class="sonic-center bordered">
		<p>I've got a folder of sonic pi songs and sounds and such on tilde.  You can find it at:</p>
		<p style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 20px;">zach/Synth-Songs/</p>
		<p>You can also find it on <a href="http://github.com/zachmandeville/Synth-Songs">github!</a></p>
		<p class="tinyboy">If you already know sonic pi and think my song code could be better, please let me know through issues or a pull request!</p>
		<p>I want to fill out this page with some of the code I'm working on, and the actual songs themselves!  If you also use sonic pi, hit me up in chat or alpine!</p>
